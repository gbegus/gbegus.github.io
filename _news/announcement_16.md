We train a ciwGAN model on reduplication in speech (a syllable [pa] gets copied, e.g. [para] -> [pa-para]). The network learns to encode an identity-based pattern in its latent space & learns to apply it to unobserved data.

For example, manipulating only the latent codes, we can turn an unreduplicated output [piru] into a reduplicated one [pipiru]. Waveform below shows a gradual transition from [piru] to [pipiru] with interpolation of latent codes.

Reduplication (copying) is extended to unobserved data. [s]-initial words were never reduplicated in training. With a  proposed technique, we can force both [s] and reduplication. The network outputs [sisiji], very similar to human outputs that were withheld from training.

*Abstract:*
This paper models unsupervised learning of an identity-based pattern (or copying) in speech called reduplication from raw continuous data with deep convolutional neural networks. We use the ciwGAN architecture Begu≈° (2021a) in which learning of meaningful representations in speech emerges from a requirement that the CNNs generate informative data. We propose a technique to wug-test CNNs trained on speech and, based on four generative tests, argue that the network learns to represent an identity-based pattern in its latent space. By manipulating only two categorical variables in the latent space, we can actively turn an unreduplicated form into a reduplicated form with no other substantial changes to the output in the majority of cases. We also argue that the network extends the identity-based pattern to unobserved data. Exploration of how meaningful representations of identity-based patterns emerge in CNNs and how the latent space variables outside of the training range correlate with identity-based patterns in the output has general implications for neural network interpretability.
