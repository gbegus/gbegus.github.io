Phonologists and phoneticians have access to really cool data that can help us understand learning in deep neural networks better. But we don't always have access to good GPUs to train the models.

We're announcing the **Deep Phonology Tool**! You can now train your own deep neural network models with your own data using our GPUs. 

We opened up our GPUs. If you have a well defined project, submit a request here:
