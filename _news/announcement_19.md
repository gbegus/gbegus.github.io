Our paper with Alan Zhou (undergraduate student at UC Berkeley) got accepted to [ICASSP 2022](https://2022.ieeeicassp.org).

We propose a technique to infer values and shapes of words in convolutional layers of unsupervised classifiers. It can help detect where in the network phone contrasts fail to get encoded.
