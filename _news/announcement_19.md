Our paper with Alan Zhou (undergraduate student at UC Berkeley) appeared in [ICASSP 2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9746849).

We propose a technique to infer values and shapes of words in convolutional layers of unsupervised classifiers. It can help detect where in the network phone contrasts fail to get encoded.
