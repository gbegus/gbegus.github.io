title: New paper in Neural Networks: deep neural network learns to produce new words
inline: false
---

The paper proposes two neural network architectures (fiwGAN and ciwGAN)  to model unsupervised learning of spoken words from raw audio and proposes a new latent space structure that can model featural learning and allows for a very low-dimension vector representation of lexical items.
