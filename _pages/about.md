I am an Assistant Professor at the [Department of Linguistics](https://lx.berkeley.edu) at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu). Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at the [University of Washington](https://linguistics.washington.edu). Before that, I graduated with a Ph.D. from [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu).

My research focuses on developing deep learning models for speech data. More specifically, I train models to learn representations of spoken words from raw audio outputs. I combine machine learning with behavioral experiments and statistical models to better understand how neural networks learn internal representations in speech and how humans learn to speak. I have worked and published on sound systems of various language families such as Indo-European, Caucasian, and Austronesian languages.

In a recent set of papers ([here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2020.00044/full) and [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02951)), I propose that language acquisition can be modeled with Generative Adversarial Networks and propose a technique for exploring the relationship between learned representations and latent space in deep convolutional networks. 

I will be building a lab on speech and computation at Berkeley. Feel free to contact me if you're interested in getting involved with the lab.
