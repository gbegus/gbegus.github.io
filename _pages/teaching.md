## Advising

Advising is one of the most important aspect of academic life. 

In graduate school, I served as a Resident Tutor in [Mather House](https://mather.harvard.edu). [Resident tutors](https://dso.college.harvard.edu/become-proctor-or-tutor) at Harvard are graduate or post-doctoral students who live in the twelve Harvard dorms
and work closely with undergraduate students on their academic, professional, and personal development.
The mission of resident tutors is to help create a safe and inclusive environment where every student can
feel a sense of belonging.

I also served as a [Sophomore Advising Coordinator](https://advising.college.harvard.edu/sophomore-advising-0) in Mather House, Harvard College. I coordinated the advising process for 120 sophomores in Mather House, led training for 28 sophomore advisers (graduate students and faculty) in the house, served as a liaison between the Advising Programs Office and advisers, organized advising events and workshops, and consulted on the advising process with university officials. I co-coordinated a pilot project to welcome incoming sophomore students in the house community which later became a model for other houses at Harvard. 

As a Fellowships Tutor, I advised undergraduate students on applications for post-graduate fellowships (Rhodes, Marshall, Fulbright) and evaluated applications. 

As a Departmental Teaching Fellow at the [Bok Center for Teaching and Learning, Harvard University](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/), I organized and led workshops on teaching and professional development for graduate students in linguistics as well as individual consultations on teaching.

I serve on a job placement committee at the Department of Linguistics, UC Berkeley. We regularly organize workshops and individual consultations for students.

I am an [ASEF Professor](https://www.asef.net/asef-professors/). The American Slovenian Education Foundation "enhances American and Slovenian education activities, uniting Slovenian scholars and educators globally."

I am happy to advise any student who reaches out to me (just send me an email).

## AI and Humanities

I co-created a study abroad summer program for undergraduate students that explores how arts and humanities can address ethical and social implications of Artificial Intelligence: [AI & Humanities in Ljubljana, Slovenia](https://courses.washington.edu/aihum/) (cancelled due to Covid19). Why in Ljubljana? The first global [UNESCO center for AI](https://ircai.org/) was recently built in Ljubljana.
